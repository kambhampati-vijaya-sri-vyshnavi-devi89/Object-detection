# AI Object Detection  

## Description  
This project uses **ml5.js** and the **COCO-SSD** model to perform real-time object detection from a live video feed. The system captures video input, processes it with a deep learning model, and visually highlights detected objects on a canvas. Users can toggle AI detection on/off and adjust the FPS (Frames Per Second) for performance optimization.

## Project Files  
- **index.html** – Main webpage structure, includes video streaming and AI integration.  
- **style.css** – Styles the page layout and UI elements.
